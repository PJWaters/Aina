## Detailed Description
The Sunken City of Qarith is a legend among the dunes, a once-thriving metropolis now buried beneath the shifting sands of the desert. It is said that Qarith was a center of magic, trade, and culture, a jewel of the ancient world that fell victim to a cataclysmic sandstorm which swallowed it whole. The tops of its grandest buildings and the tips of its highest towers occasionally become visible after particularly fierce sandstorms, offering a haunting glimpse into its past glory. Adventurers and treasure hunters are drawn to Qarith's promise of ancient artifacts, magical relics, and the mysteries of a lost civilization, but few have penetrated its depths, and fewer still have returned.

On rare nights, when the sands shift and the wind stills, the city's ghostly silhouette emerges from its sandy grave, casting long shadows and beckoning the brave and the foolish with the lure of forgotten treasures. The air around the city is thick with the magic of old, a palpable presence that hints at the wonders and dangers lurking beneath the surface. Walking among the remnants of Qarith is a walk through history, where every stone and artifact tells a story of a civilization lost to time and the relentless march of nature.
