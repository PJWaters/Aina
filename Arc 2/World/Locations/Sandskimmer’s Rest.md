## Detailed Description
Sandskimmer’s Rest is a unique oasis nestled within a shallow depression in the desert, famed for its remarkably clear and calm waters.

Unlike other oases, Sandskimmer’s Rest is surrounded by fine, almost silvery sand that is said to shimmer under the moonlight, giving the place an ethereal quality.
