## Detailed Description
Starwatcher’s Spire is a solitary tower that rises from the desert's embrace, a relic of an age when the stars guided the fate of civilizations. Built from a unique blend of stone and meteoric iron, the spire catches the sun's rays by day and mirrors the stars by night, serving as a beacon for travelers and a symbol of the desert's ancient wisdom. The interior of the spire is adorned with intricate celestial maps and astronomical instruments, some of which remain a mystery to modern scholars. It is said that the spire was once a gathering place for astronomers, mages, and seers who sought to unlock the secrets of the cosmos through the study of the stars.
