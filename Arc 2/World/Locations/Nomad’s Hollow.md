Nomad’s Hollow is a secluded valley hidden within the folds of the desert, known only to those who wander its vastness with a keen eye and a knowledge of the old ways. This natural basin is encircled by towering dunes, providing shelter from the relentless desert winds and creating a microclimate that supports a surprising abundance of life. At its heart lies a spring-fed pond, around which the flora and fauna of the desert converge, creating an oasis of biodiversity. Nomad’s Hollow serves as a seasonal home for various nomadic tribes, who leave behind no trace of their passage save for the stories told around campfires, woven into the tapestry of the desert's lore.
