Roll a d6 for encounters the party may face during the night in the desert:

1. **Glowing Scorpions**: A cluster of bioluminescent scorpions, harmless unless provoked.
2. **Desert Spirit**: A benign spirit of the desert appears, offering a cryptic piece of advice or prophecy.
3. **Thief in the Camp**: A lone thief attempts to steal from the party's supplies.
4. **Nocturnal Predator**: A predator, like a sand cat or desert wolf, stalks the camp, drawn by the scent of food.
5. **Starfall**: A meteor shower lights up the night sky, possibly leading to the discovery of meteorite iron.
6. **Ghostly Procession**: Spectral figures traverse the desert, ignoring the party but potentially leading them to something valuable or dangerous.
