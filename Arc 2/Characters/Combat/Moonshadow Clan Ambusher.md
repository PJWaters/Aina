**DESCRIPTION**

Moonshadow Ambushers are elite warriors of the Moonshadow Clan, trained in the art of stealth and surprise attacks. Cloaked in shadows, they wear dark fabrics that blend seamlessly with the night. Their faces are often covered by masks or veils, leaving only their piercing eyes visible. Silent and deadly, they strike from the darkness, using the element of surprise to overwhelm their enemies before vanishing without a trace.
