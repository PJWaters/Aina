**DESCRIPTION**

Dominion Soldiers are the backbone of the Zephyrian Dominion's military might, clad in chain mail and bearing the empire's insignia. They are disciplined and loyal, trained to fight in harsh desert conditions. Their faces are stern, eyes accustomed to the blinding sands, and they move as one cohesive unit, ready to lay down their lives for the empire.
