**DESCRIPTION**

The War Machine is a formidable construct of the Zephyrian Dominion, a towering behemoth of metal and magic designed for siege warfare. Its iron-clad body is inscribed with runes of power, and its limbs are equipped with blades and cannons. The War Machine moves with a mechanical, unyielding purpose, driven by the will of its Dominion masters to crush their foes. Its presence on the battlefield is a harbinger of destruction, capable of decimating fortifications and infantry with equal ease.
