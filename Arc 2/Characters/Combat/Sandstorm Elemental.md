**DESCRIPTION**

A Sandstorm Elemental is a swirling mass of sand and wind, given sentience through ancient desert magics. It takes the form of a towering, vaguely humanoid shape, with glowing eyes that pierce through the whirlwind of its body. Born from the fiercest sandstorms, it guards sacred places of the desert or wanders the dunes, attacking those who disturb the desert's peace.
