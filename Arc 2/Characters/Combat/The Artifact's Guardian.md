**ACTIONS**

- **Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Sand Blast (Recharge 5-6).** The guardian blasts sand in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**REACTION**

- **Sand Shield.** When the guardian takes damage from a source within 30 feet of it, it can create a swirling shield of sand to grant itself +2 AC against that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.

**DESCRIPTION**

The Artifact's Guardian is an ancient construct, created by a long-lost civilization to protect its most sacred relics. Standing tall amidst the ruins, its body is carved from stone and inlaid with gleaming metals and mysterious, glowing runes. Despite its age, the guardian moves with a precision and grace that belies its massive form. Its eyes, two luminous gems, survey its domain with an intelligence that hints at a deep, magical awareness. Silent and imposing, the guardian represents the pinnacle of ancient magic and engineering, a formidable protector of the secrets it was built to keep.
