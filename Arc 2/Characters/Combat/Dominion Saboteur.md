**DESCRIPTION**

Dominion Saboteurs are specially trained agents of the Zephyrian Dominion, skilled in stealth, espionage, and destruction. They wear dark leathers and masks to conceal their identities, moving with a silent grace. Their mission is to undermine enemy fortifications, steal important documents, or assassinate key figures to weaken the opposition before a full-scale attack.
