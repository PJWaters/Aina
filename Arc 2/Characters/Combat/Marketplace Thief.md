**DESCRIPTION**

Marketplace Thieves are a common sight in the bustling markets and narrow alleyways of desert towns. Quick and cunning, they snatch purses, peddle stolen goods, and disappear before their victims realize what's happened. Dressed in simple clothes to blend with the crowd, their eyes are always watching, calculating their next target.
