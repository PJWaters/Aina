## Description
The Independent Groups comprise a collection of nomads, merchants, exiles, and adventurers who traverse the Shifting Sands. Lacking the unified structure or allegiance of the larger factions, these individuals and small bands pursue their own goals, be they trade, exploration, or survival.

## Home
Independents are found throughout the Shifting Sands, making temporary homes in caravans, oases, and the ruins scattered across the desert. Some prefer the relative safety of the outskirts, while others delve deep into the desert's heart in search of fortune or sanctuary.

## Leader
- **No central leadership** - Each group or individual operates independently, though charismatic or influential figures like Rashid the Wanderer often emerge, drawing followers or forming temporary alliances.

## Political Structure
The very nature of the Independent Groups defies a formal political structure. Leadership, when it exists, is fluid and based on respect, expertise, or necessity rather than hierarchy or tradition.

## Relationship with Other Factions
- **Sunspears:** Generally friendly; trade and mutual aid are common.
- **Moonshadow Clan:** Cautious interaction; respect for the clan's territory and secrets is paramount.
- **Sandweavers:** Neutral, with occasional exchanges of knowledge or goods.
- **Zephyrian Dominion:** Varied; some may see opportunities for profit in aligning with the Dominion, while others view its expansion as a threat to their way of life.
